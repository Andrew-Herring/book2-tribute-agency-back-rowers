      <p>The British street artist Banksy pulled off one of his most spectacular pranks on Friday night, when one of
        his
        trademark paintings appeared to self-destruct at Sotheby’s in London after selling for $1.4 million at auction.
      </p>
      <p>The work, “Girl With Balloon,” a 2006 spray paint on canvas, was the last lot of Sotheby’s “Frieze Week”
        evening
        contemporary art sale. After competition between two telephone bidders, it was hammered down by the auctioneer
        Oliver Barker for 1 million pounds, more than three times the estimate and a new auction high for a work solely
        by the artist, according to Sotheby’s.
      </p>
      “Then we heard an alarm go off,” Morgan Long, the head of art investment at the London-based advisory firm Fine
      Art Group, who was sitting in the front row of the room, said in an interview on Saturday. “Everyone turned
      round, and the picture had slipped through its frame.”
      <p>
        The painting, mounted on a wall close to a row of Sotheby’s staff members, had been shredded, or at least
        partially shredded, by a remote-control mechanism on the back of the frame.</p>
